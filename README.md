### Hello Webmasters of the future! Welcome to the EST Site Repository. Hopefully you have some background using Node.js, React, HTML and CSS. Keep recruiting CS majors or else we're doomed. 

To start the app in development mode (to update the website), clone the repo locally. In terminal, navigate to whichever folder you've set the repo up in, and run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

If you see any errors, all I can say is to Google them. Node is constantly changing things and packages are constantly depreciating. Hopefully React and Bootstrap stick around until you get sick of this website. 

For the most part, you'll only be making **content** changes to the website. If you're looking to make layout changes, add/remove pages, see the more in depth how-to in the repo.

### Text Changes

Open the corresponding .js file for whatever page you're looking to edit. For example, if you want to edit the "Application" page to close the application, open "Application.js" (src/pages/apply/Application.js) 

to be finished later...

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
